# libGDX lazy snippets

A collection of code snippets for the lazy [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) user.

- Aimed for desktop projects, so the code might not (probably won't) run on HTML5 and mobile.
- Is written/compiled with JDK 8, and may use Java 1.8 language features.
- Invades the ```com.badlogic.gdx.*``` namespace.
- No external dependencies.
